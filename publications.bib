 abstract= {Eye movements were recorded while participants discriminated upright and inverted faces that differed with respect to either configural or featural information. Two hypotheses were examined: (1) whether featural and configural information processing elicit different scanning patterns; (2) whether fixations on a specific region of the face dominate scanning patterns. Results from two experiments were compared to examine whether participants' prior knowledge of the kind of information that would be relevant for the task (i.e.,
 configural vs featural) influences eye movements. In Experiment 1,
 featural and configural discrimination trials were presented in random order such that participants were unaware of the information that would be relevant on any given trial. In Experiment 2,
 featural and configural discrimination trials were blocked and participants were informed of the nature of the discriminations. The results of both experiments suggest that faces elicit different scanning patterns depending on task demands. When participants were unaware of the nature of the information relevant for the task at hand,
 face processing was dominated by attention to the eyes. When participants were aware that relational information was relevant,
 scanning was dominated by fixations to the center of the face. We conclude that faces elicit scanning strategies that are driven by task demands.},
