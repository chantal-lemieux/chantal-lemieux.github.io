My main research interests are in Cognitive Psychology where I have experience in several areas within the domain of higher-order cognition, including face perception, spatial cognition, metacognition and driving. Most recently, I have been focused on gender differences in spatial cognition, particularly visual spatial cue processing and performance monitoring. I am particularly excited to be teaching Sensation and Perception where I have several physical in-class demonstrations and illusions which make for a fun course! My other teaching interests include: Introduction to Behavioural Neuroscience, Scientific Method and Analysis, and Laboratories in Psychology.

Outside of academics, I am a proud mother to two curious boys who enjoy the outdoors going on nature walks and hikes with our dog. I enjoy yoga, playing soccer, and gardening. Most of all I love to travel. I have been to Thailand, Cambodia, India, Philippines, various countries in Europe, and the US and hope to grow this list throughout the years.
