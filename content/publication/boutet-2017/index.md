abstract: "Eye movements were recorded while participants discriminated upright and\
  \ inverted faces that differed with respect to either configural or featural information.\
  \ Two hypotheses were examined: (1) whether featural and configural information\
  \ processing elicit different scanning patterns; (2) whether fixations on a specific\
  \ region of the face dominate scanning patterns. Results from two experiments were\
  \ compared to examine whether participants' prior knowledge of the kind of information\
  \ that would be relevant for the task (i.e., configural vs featural) influences\
  \ eye movements. In Experiment 1, featural and configural discrimination trials\
  \ were presented in random order such that participants were unaware of the information\
  \ that would be relevant on any given trial. In Experiment 2, featural and configural\
  \ discrimination trials were blocked and participants were informed of the nature\
  \ of the discriminations. The results of both experiments suggest that faces elicit\
  \ different scanning patterns depending on task demands. When participants were\
  \ unaware of the nature of the information relevant for the task at hand, face processing\
  \ was dominated by attention to the eyes. When participants were aware that relational\
  \ information was relevant, scanning was dominated by fixations to the center of\
  \ the face. We conclude that faces elicit scanning strategies that are driven by\
  \ task demands."
